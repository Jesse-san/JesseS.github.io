## MS in Quantitative Economics 

Hello! I am a United States Veteran with 5 years of service in the Navy and 3 years in the Air-Force reserves. I served as a medical laboratory technician where I specialized in microbiology, but I decided to make a career change into economics and data analytics. This change was caused by one of the most fundamental and simple questios: What drives us to make decisions when we have a plethora of options to choose from? Exploring this question led me to San Luis Obispo where I earned my MS in Quantitative Economics. 

Here are some projects that I have been working on :
